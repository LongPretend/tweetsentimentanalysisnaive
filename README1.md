# Naive Tweet sentiment analysis
Naive sentiment analysis done with just a list of positive and negative words (https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html#lexicon)

Was done as part of an interview for a bank hence the variables with bankname, bank etc

To use create a file config.r and create the details as outlined in comments

Obvious inspiration from here (http://www.r-bloggers.com/sentiment-analysis-on-donald-trump-using-r-and-tableau/)
