naive sentiment analysis done with just a list of positive and negative words

This was a quick project done for an interview I was doing for a bank

Due to time constraints I relied on a basic word list to do the actual sentiment analysis (this is very naive)

config.r had all of my twitter details and so it wasnt included, however it was described in the tweetanalyzer.r file
